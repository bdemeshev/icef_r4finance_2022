Note: the forecasting field is rapidly evolving and these two courses use old syntax. 
The code will work but some things may be done simplier :)

If you think that these two courses are useless for you then just write me a letter and propose any two other datacamp time series courses as a replacement.
Probably I will accept your proposal.
